ðŸŽ“ STUDENT GRADING SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION
q  The Student Grading System is a web-based platform designed to streamline and automate the management of student academic records. It allows administrators to add, update, delete, and view student marks efficiently, while providing students with an easy and secure way to check their results online.
  The system reduces manual effort, eliminates calculation errors, ensures data accuracy, and promotes transparency through centralized result management. This solution is ideal for schools, colleges, and coaching centers seeking a digital approach to academic evaluation.

TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
  HTML structures the web pages including forms, tables, and panels.
  CSS handles styling, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive layouts.
  JavaScript manages interactivity, form validation, dynamic table updates, and total marks calculation.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  Node.js executes server-side logic and handles API requests.
  Express.js simplifies routing and RESTful API endpoint creation for CRUD operations.

Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
  Stores student and admin data in a structured, flexible JSON-like format.
  Supports fast retrieval, updates, and ensures data integrity.

Utilities: CORS, Body-Parser
  Enables secure cross-origin requests and parses incoming JSON request bodies.

Deployment: GitHub Pages (Frontend), Render / Vercel (Backend)
  Makes the application accessible online without needing local servers.
